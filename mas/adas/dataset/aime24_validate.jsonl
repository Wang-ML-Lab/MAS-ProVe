Thus, we have the equation $(240-t)(s) = 540$, and by the same logic, the second equation yields $(144-t)(s+2) = 540$. We have $240s-st = 540$, and $288+144s-2t-st = 540$. We subtract the two equations to get $96s+2t-288 = 0$, so we have $48s+t = 144$, so $t = 144-48s$, and now we have $(96+48s)(s) = 540$. The numerator of $s$ must evenly divide 540, however, $s$ must be less than 3. We can guess that $s = 2.5$. Now, $2.5+0.5 = 3$. Taking $\\frac{9}{3} = 3$, we find that it will take three hours for the 9 kilometers to be traveled. The t minutes spent at the coffeeshop can be written as $144-48(2.5)$, so t = 24. $180 + 24 = 204$. -sepehr2010", "answer": "204", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2024_AIME_I_Problems/Problem_1"}

Make sure to count them as two points and not one, or you'll get $384$.\nWe will denote $h(x)=4g(f(x))$ for simplicity. Denote $p(x)$ as the first equation and $q(y)$ as the graph of the second. We notice that both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ oscillate between 0 and 1. The intersections are thus all in the square $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,1)$, and $(1,0)$.

At this point, $q(y)$ has an infinite downwards slope and $p(x)$ is slanted, giving us an extra intersection; thus, we need to add 1 to our answer to get $\\boxed{385}$.\n~Xyco\nWe can easily see that only $x, y \\in \\left[0,1 \\right]$ may satisfy both functions.\nWe call function $y = 4g \\left( f \\left( \\sin \\left( 2 \\pi x \\right) \\right) \\right)$ as Function 1 and function $x = 4g \\left( f \\left( \\cos \\left( 3 \\pi y \\right) \\right) \\right)$ as Function 2.\nFor Function 1, in each interval $\\left[ \\frac{i}{4} , \\frac{i+1}{4} \\right]$ with $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 3 \\right\\}$, Function 1's value oscillates between 0 and 1. It attains 1 at $x = \\frac{i}{4}$, $\\frac{i+1}{4}$ and another point between these two.\nBetween two consecutive points whose functional values are 1, the function first decreases from 1 to 0 and then increases from 0 to 1. \nSo the graph of this function in this interval consists of 4 monotonic pieces.\nFor Function 2, in each interval $\\left[ \\frac{i}{6} , \\frac{i+1}{6} \\right]$ with $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 5 \\right\\}$, Function 2's value oscillates between 0 and 1. It attains 1 at $y = \\frac{i}{6}$, $\\frac{i+1}{6}$ and another point between these two.\nBetween two consecutive points whose functional values are 1, the function first decreases from 1 to 0 and then increases from 0 to 1.\nSo the graph of this function in this interval consists of 4 monotonic curves.\nConsider any region $\\left[ \\frac{i}{4} , \\frac{i+1}{4} \\right] \\times \\left[ \\frac{j}{6} , \\frac{j+1}{6} \\right]$ with $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 3 \\right\\}$ and $j \\in \\left\\{0, 1, \\cdots , 5 \\right\\}$ but $\\left( i, j \\right) \\neq \\left( 3, 5 \\right)$.\nBoth functions have four monotonic pieces.\nBecause Function 1's each monotonic piece can take any value in  $\\left[ \\frac{j}{6} , \\frac{j+1}{6} \\right]$ and Function 2' each monotonic piece can take any value in  $\\left[ \\frac{i}{4} , \\frac{i+1}{4} \\right]$, Function 1's each monotonic piece intersects with Function 2's each monotonic piece. \nTherefore, in the interval $\\left[ \\frac{i}{4} , \\frac{i+1}{4} \\right] \\times \\left[ \\frac{j}{6} , \\frac{j+1}{6} \\right]$, the number of intersecting points is $4 \\cdot 4 = 16$.\nNext, we prove that if an intersecting point is on a line $x = \\frac{i}{4}$ for $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 4 \\right\\}$, then this point must be $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$.\nFor $x = \\frac{i}{4}$, Function 1 attains value 1. \nFor Function 2, if $y = 1$, then $x = 1$. \nTherefore, the intersecting point is $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$.\nSimilarly, we can prove that if an intersecting point is on a line $y = \\frac{i}{6}$ for $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 6 \\right\\}$, then this point must be $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$.\nTherefore, in each region $\\left[ \\frac{i}{4} , \\frac{i+1}{4} \\right] \\times \\left[ \\frac{j}{6} , \\frac{j+1}{6} \\right]$ with $i \\in \\left\\{ 0, 1, \\cdots, 3 \\right\\}$ and $j \\in \\left\\{0, 1, \\cdots , 5 \\right\\}$ but $\\left( i, j \\right) \\neq \\left( 3, 5 \\right)$, all 16 intersecting points are interior.\nThat is, no two regions share any common intersecting point.\nNext, we study region  $\\left[ \\frac{3}{4} , 1 \\right] \\times \\left[ \\frac{5}{6} , 1 \\right]$.\nConsider any pair of monotonic pieces, where one is from Function 1 and one is from Function 2, except the pair of two monotonic pieces from two functions that attain $\\left( 1 , 1 \\right)$.\nTwo pieces in each pair intersects at an interior point on the region.\nSo the number of intersecting points is $4 \\cdot 4 - 1 = 15$.\nFinally, we compute the number intersection points of two functions' monotonic pieces that both attain $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$.\nOne trivial intersection point is $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$.\nNow, we study whether they intersect at another point.\nDefine $x = 1 - x'$ and $y = 1 - y'$.\nThus, for positive and sufficiently small $x'$ and $y'$, Function 1 is reduced to\n\\[ y' = 4 \\sin 2 \\pi x' \\hspace{1cm} (1) \\]\nand Function 2 is reduced to\n\\[ x' = 4 \\left( 1 - \\cos 3 \\pi y' \\right) . \\hspace{1cm} (2) \\]\nNow, we study whether there is a non-zero solution.\nBecause we consider sufficiently small $x'$ and $y'$, to get an intuition and quick estimate, we do approximations of the above equations.\nEquation (1) is approximated as\n\\[ y' = 4 \\cdot 2 \\pi x' \\]\nand Equation (2) is approximated as\n\\[ x' = 2 \\left( 3 \\pi y' \\right)^2  \\]\nTo solve these equations, we get $x' = \\frac{1}{8^2 \\cdot 18 \\pi^4}$ and $y' = \\frac{1}{8 \\cdot 18 \\pi^3}$.\nTherefore, two functions' two monotonic pieces that attain $\\left( 1, 1 \\right)$ have two intersecting points.\nPutting all analysis above, the total number of intersecting points is $16 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6 + 1 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(385) }}$.\n~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com)", "answer": "385", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2024_AIME_I_Problems/Problem_12"}

If $r$ is the inradius, i.e the distance to the faces, then $\\frac{1}{3} r([ABC] + [ABD] + [ACD] + [BCD])$ must the volume.
