{"id": 66, "problem": "Let $\\mathcal{B}$ be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area $54$ and volume $23$. Let $r$ be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of $\\mathcal{B}$. The value of $r^2$ can be written as $\\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $p+q$.", "solution": "Observe that the \"worst\" possible box is one of the maximum possible length. \nBy symmetry, the height and the width are the same in this antioptimal box. (If the height and width weren't the same, the extra difference between them could be used to make the length longer.) Thus, let the width and height be of length $a$ and the length be $L$. \nWe're given that the volume is $23$; thus, $a^2L=23$. We're also given that the surface area is $54=2\\cdot27$; thus, $a^2+2aL=27$. \nFrom the first equation, we can get $L=\\dfrac{23}{a^2}$. We do a bunch of algebra: \n\\begin{align*}\nL&=\\dfrac{23}{a^2} \\\\\n27&=a^2+2aL \\\\\n&=a^2+2a\\left(\\dfrac{23}{a^2}\\right) \\\\\n&=a^2+\\dfrac{46}a \\\\\n27a&=a^3+46 \\\\\na^3-27a+46&=0. \\\\\n\\end{align*}\nWe can use the Rational Root Theorem and test a few values. It turns out that $a=2$ works. We use synthetic division to divide by $a-2$: \n[Asdf.png](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/File:Asdf.png)\nAs we expect, the remainder is $0$, and we are left with the polynomial $x^2+2x-23$. We can now simply use the quadratic formula and find that the remaining roots are $\\dfrac{-2\\pm\\sqrt{4-4(-23)}}2=\\dfrac{-2\\pm\\sqrt{96}}2=\\dfrac{-2\\pm4\\sqrt{6}}2=-1\\pm2\\sqrt6$. We want the smallest $a$ to maximize $L$, and it turns out that $a=2$ is in fact the smallest root. Thus, we let $a=2$. Substituting this into $L=\\dfrac{23}{a^2}$, we find that $L=\\dfrac{23}4$. However, this is not our answer! This is simply the length of the box; we want the radius of the sphere enclosing it. We know that the diameter of the sphere is the diagonal of the box, and the 3D Pythagorean Theorem can give us the space diagonal. Applying it, we find that the diagonal has length $\\sqrt{2^2+2^2+\\left(\\dfrac{23}4\\right)^2}=\\sqrt{8+\\dfrac{529}{16}}=\\sqrt{\\dfrac{128+529}{16}}=\\dfrac{\\sqrt{657}}4$. This is the diameter; we halve it to find the radius, $\\dfrac{\\sqrt{657}}8$. We then square this and end up with $\\dfrac{657}{64}$, giving us an answer of $657+64=\\boxed{721}$. \n~Technodoggo\nDenote by $x$, $y$, $z$ the length, width, and height of a rectangular box.\nWe have\n\\begin{align*}\nxy + yz + zx & = \\frac{54}{2}  \\hspace{1cm} (1) \\\\\nxyz & = 23 \\hspace{1cm} (2)\n\\end{align*}\nWe have\n\\begin{align*}\n4 r^2 & = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\\\\n& = \\left( x + y + z \\right)^2 - 2 \\cdot \\left( xy + yz + zx \\right) \\\\\n& = \\left( x + y + z \\right)^2 - 54 .\n\\end{align*}\nTherefore, we solve the following constrained optimization problem:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\max_{x,y,z} \\ & x + y + z \\\\\n\\mbox{subject to } & (1), (2) \n\\end{align*}\nFirst, we prove that an optimal solution must have at least two out of $x$, $y$, $z$ that are the same.\nDenote by $\\lambda$ and $\\eta$ lagrangian multipliers of constraints (1) and (2), respectively. \nConsider the following Lagrangian:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\max_{x,y,z, \\lambda, \\eta} & x + y + z + \\lambda \\left( xy + yz + zx - 27 \\right)\n+ \\eta \\left( xyz - 23 \\right) .\n\\end{align*}\nTaking first-order-condition with respect to $x$, $y$, $z$, respectively, we get\n\\begin{align*}\n1 + \\lambda \\left( y + z \\right) + \\eta yz & = 0 \\hspace{1cm} (3) \\\\\n1 + \\lambda \\left( z + x \\right) + \\eta zx & = 0 \\hspace{1cm} (4) \\\\\n1 + \\lambda \\left( x + y \\right) + \\eta xy & = 0 \\hspace{1cm} (5)\n\\end{align*}\nSuppose there is an optimal solution with $x$, $y$, $z$ that are all distinct.\nTaking $(4)-(3)$, we get\n\\[ \\left( x - y \\right) \\left( \\lambda + \\eta z \\right) = 0 . \\]\nBecause $x \\neq y$, we have\n\\[ \\lambda + \\eta z = 0 \\hspace{1cm} (6) \\]\nAnalogously, we have\n\\begin{align*}\n\\lambda + \\eta x & = 0 \\hspace{1cm} (7) \n\\end{align*} \nTaking $(6) - (7)$, we get $\\eta \\left( z - x \\right) = 0$.\nBecause $z \\neq x$, we have $\\eta = 0$.

{"id": 68, "problem": "Alice and Bob play the following game. A stack of $n$ tokens lies before them. The players take turns with Alice going first. On each turn, the player removes either $1$ token or $4$ tokens from the stack. Whoever removes the last token wins. Find the number of positive integers $n$ less than or equal to $2024$ for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play.", "solution": "Let's first try some experimentation. Alice obviously wins if there is one coin. She will just take it and win. If there are 2 remaining, then Alice will take one and then Bob will take one, so Bob wins. If there are $3$, Alice will take $1$, Bob will take one, and Alice will take the final one. If there are $4$, Alice will just remove all $4$ at once. If there are $5$, no matter what Alice does, Bob can take the final coins in one try. Notice that Alice wins if there are $1$, $3$, or $4$ coins left. Bob wins if there are $2$ or $5$ coins left.\nAfter some thought, you may realize that there is a strategy for Bob. If there is n is a multiple of $5$, then Bob will win. The reason for this is the following: Let's say there are a multiple of $5$ coins remaining in the stack. If Alice takes $1$, Bob will take $4$, and there will still be a multiple of $5$. If Alice takes $4$, Bob will take $1$, and there will still be a multiple of $5$. This process will continue until you get $0$ coins left. For example, let's say there are $205$ coins. No matter what Alice does, Bob can simply just do the complement. After each of them make a turn, there will always be a multiple of $5$ left. This will continue until there are $5$ coins left, and Bob will end up winning.\nAfter some more experimentation, you'll realize that any number that is congruent to $2$ mod $5$ will also work. This is because Bob can do the same strategy, and when there are $2$ coins left, Alice is forced to take $1$ and Bob takes the final coin. For example, let's say there are $72$ coins. If Alice takes $1$, Bob will take $4$. If Alice takes $4$, Bob will take $1$. So after they each make a turn, the number will always be equal to $2$ mod $5$. Eventually, there will be only $2$ coins remaining, and we've established that Alice will simply take $1$ and Bob will take the final coin.\nSo we have to find the number of numbers less than or equal to $2024$ that are either congruent to $0$ mod $5$ or $2$ mod $5$. There are $404$ numbers in the first category: $5, 10, 15, \\dots, 2020$. For the second category, there are $405$ numbers. $2, 7, 12, 17, \\dots, 2022$.

In other words, there will be $2$ losing positions out of every $5$ consecutive values of n. As $n$ ranges from $1$ to $2020$, $\\frac{2}{5}$ of these values are losing positions where Bob will win. As $n$ ranges from $2021$ to $2024$, $2022$ is the only value where Bob will win.

Because Bob has the only choice of taking 1 token, Alice can take the last token and win the game.\nTherefore, in this case, under Alice's this strategy, Bob has no way to win.\nPutting all cases together, the answer is $404 + 405 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(809) }}$.\nSince the game Alice and Bob play is impartial (the only difference between player 1 and player 2 is that player 1 goes first (note that games like chess are not impartial because each player can only move their own pieces)), we can use the Sprague-Grundy Theorem to solve this problem.

{"id": 69, "problem": "Jen enters a lottery by picking $4$ distinct numbers from $S=\\{1,2,3,\\cdots,9,10\\}.$ $4$ numbers are randomly chosen from $S.$ She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were $2$ of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers were the randomly chosen numbers. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.", "solution": "This is a conditional probability problem. Bayes' Theorem states that \n\\[P(A|B)=\\dfrac{P(B|A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\\]\n\nin other words, the probability of $A$ given $B$ is equal to the probability of $B$ given $A$ times the probability of $A$ divided by the probability of $B$. In our case, $A$ represents the probability of winning the grand prize, and $B$ represents the probability of winning a prize. Clearly, $P(B|A)=1$, since by winning the grand prize you automatically win a prize. Thus, we want to find $\\dfrac{P(A)}{P(B)}$.\nLet us calculate the probability of winning a prize. We do this through casework: how many of Jen's drawn numbers match the lottery's drawn numbers? \nTo win a prize, Jen must draw at least $2$ numbers identical to the lottery. Thus, our cases are drawing $2$, $3$, or $4$ numbers identical. \nLet us first calculate the number of ways to draw exactly $2$ identical numbers to the lottery. Let Jen choose the numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$; we have $\\dbinom42$ ways to choose which $2$ of these $4$ numbers are identical to the lottery. We have now determined $2$ of the $4$ numbers drawn in the lottery; since the other $2$ numbers Jen chose can not be chosen by the lottery, the lottery now has $10-2-2=6$ numbers to choose the last $2$ numbers from. Thus, this case is $\\dbinom62$, so this case yields $\\dbinom42\\dbinom62=6\\cdot15=90$ possibilities. \nNext, let us calculate the number of ways to draw exactly $3$ identical numbers to the lottery. Again, let Jen choose $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. This time, we have $\\dbinom43$ ways to choose the identical numbers and again $6$ numbers left for the lottery to choose from; however, since $3$ of the lottery's numbers have already been determined, the lottery only needs to choose $1$ more number, so this is $\\dbinom61$. This case yields $\\dbinom43\\dbinom61=4\\cdot6=24$. \nFinally, let us calculate the number of ways to all $4$ numbers matching. There is actually just one way for this to happen. \nIn total, we have $90+24+1=115$ ways to win a prize. The lottery has $\\dbinom{10}4=210$ possible combinations to draw, so the probability of winning a prize is $\\dfrac{115}{210}$. There is actually no need to simplify it or even evaluate $\\dbinom{10}4$ or actually even know that it has to be $\\dbinom{10}4$; it suffices to call it $a$ or some other variable, as it will cancel out later.

If you go up first, you will end on the side opposite to it (the right side) and if you go right first, you will end up on the top. It can then be observed that if you choose the turning points in the middle $7 \\times 7$ grid, that will automatically determine your start and ending points. For example, in the diagram if you choose the point $(3,2)$ and $(5,3)$, you must first move three up or two right, determining your first point, and move 5 up or 3 right, determining your final point. Knowing this is helpful because if we first move anywhere horizontally, we have $7$ points on each column to choose from and starting from left to right, we have $6,5,4,3,2,1$ points on that row to choose from. This gives us $7(6)+7(5)+7(4)+7(3)+7(2)+7(1)$ which simplifies to $7\\cdot21$. The vertical case is symmetrical so we have $7\\cdot21\\cdot2 = \\boxed{294}$\n~KEVIN_LIU\nAs in Solution 1, there are two cases: $RURUR$ or $URURU$. We will work with the first case and multiply by $2$ at the end. We use stars and bars; we can treat the $R$s as the stars and the $U$s as the bars. However, we must also use stars and bars on the $U$s to see how many different patterns of bars we can create for the reds. We must have $1$ bar in $8$ blacks, so we use stars and bars on the equation \\[x + y = 8\\]. However, each divider must have at least one black in it, so we do the change of variable $x' = x-1$ and $y' = x-1$. Our equation becomes \\[x' + y' = 6\\]. By stars and bars, this equation has $\\binom{6 + 2 - 1}{1} = 7$ valid solutions. Now, we use stars and bars on the reds. We must distribute two bars amongst the reds, so we apply stars and bars to \\[x + y + z = 8\\]. Since each group must have one red, we again do a change of variables with $x' = x-1$, $y' = y-1$, and $z' = z-1$. We are now working on the equation \\[x' + y' + z' = 5\\]. By stars and bars, this has $\\binom{5 + 3 - 1}{2} = 21$ solutions. The number of valid paths in this case is the number of ways to create the bars times the number of valid arrangements of the stars given fixed bars, which equals $21 \\cdot 7 = 147$.

Notice that we have a $-108b$ in the expression; to maximize the expression, we want $b$ to be negative so that $-108b$ is positive and thus contributes more to the expression.

Substituting $a$ in terms of $x$ and $b$ gives us $\\frac{x^2+8bx+16b^2}{9}+b^2=16$. Combining fractions, multiplying, and rearranging, gives $25b^2+8xb+(x^2-144)=0$.

If we set the equations equal, we have $\\frac{1190}{11} = a+b$. Call the radius of the incircle $r$, then we have the side BC to be $r(a+b)$. We find $r$ as $\\frac{4046+\\frac{1190}{11}}{\\frac{1190}{11}}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{10+((34)(11))}{10}$,so we have $\\frac{192}{5}$, which sums to $\\boxed{197}$.\nAssume that $ABC$ is isosceles with $AB=AC$.\nIf we let $P_1$ be the intersection of $BC$ and the leftmost of the eight circles of radius $34$, $N_1$ the center of the leftmost circle, and $M_1$ the intersection of the leftmost circle and $AB$, and we do the same for the $2024$ circles of radius $1$, naming the points $P_2$, $N_2$, and $M_2$, respectively, then we see that $BP_1N_1M_1\\sim BP_2N_2M_2$.

Find $AB\\cdot AC$.", "solution": "Start off by (of course) drawing a diagram! Let $I$ and $O$ be the incenter and circumcenters of triangle $ABC$, respectively. Furthermore, extend $AI$ to meet $BC$ at $L$ and the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$ at $D$.\n\n\nWe'll tackle the initial steps of the problem in two different manners, both leading us to the same final calculations.\nSince $I$ is the incenter, $\\angle BAL \\cong \\angle DAC$. Furthermore, $\\angle ABC$ and $\\angle ADC$ are both subtended by the same arc $AC$, so $\\angle ABC \\cong \\angle ADC.$ Therefore by AA similarity, $\\triangle ABL \\sim \\triangle ADC$. \nFrom this we can say that \\[\\frac{AB}{AD} = \\frac{AL}{AC} \\implies AB \\cdot AC = AL \\cdot AD\\]\nSince $AD$ is a chord of the circle and $OI$ is a perpendicular from the center to that chord, $OI$ must bisect $AD$. This can be seen by drawing $OD$ and recognizing that this creates two congruent right triangles. Therefore, \\[AD = 2 \\cdot ID \\implies AB \\cdot AC = 2 \\cdot AL \\cdot ID\\]\nWe have successfully represented $AB \\cdot AC$ in terms of $AL$ and $ID$. Solution 1.2 will explain an alternate method to get a similar relationship, and then we'll rejoin and finish off the solution.\n$\\angle ALB \\cong \\angle DLC$ by vertical angles and $\\angle LBA \\cong \\angle CDA$ because both are subtended by arc $AC$. Thus $\\triangle ABL \\sim \\triangle CDL$.\nThus \\[\\frac{AB}{CD} = \\frac{AL}{CL} \\implies AB = CD \\cdot \\frac{AL}{CL}\\]\nSymmetrically, we get $\\triangle ALC \\sim \\triangle BLD$, so\n\\[\\frac{AC}{BD} = \\frac{AL}{BL} \\implies AC = BD \\cdot \\frac{AL}{BL}\\]\nSubstituting, we  get \\[AB \\cdot AC = CD \\cdot \\frac{AL}{CL} \\cdot BD \\cdot \\frac{AL}{BL}\\]\nLemma 1: BD = CD = ID\nProof: \nWe commence angle chasing: we know $\\angle DBC \\cong DAC = \\gamma$. Therefore \\[\\angle IBD = \\alpha + \\gamma\\].\nLooking at triangle $ABI$, we see that $\\angle IBA = \\alpha$, and $\\angle BAI = \\gamma$. Therefore because the sum of the angles must be $180$, $\\angle BIA = 180-\\alpha - \\gamma$. Now $AD$ is a straight line, so \\[\\angle BID = 180-\\angle BIA = \\alpha+\\gamma\\].\nSince $\\angle IBD = \\angle BID$, triangle $IBD$ is isosceles and thus $ID = BD$. \nA similar argument should suffice to show $CD = ID$ by symmetry, so thus $ID = BD = CD$.\nNow we regroup and get \\[CD \\cdot \\frac{AL}{CL} \\cdot BD \\cdot \\frac{AL}{BL} = ID^2 \\cdot \\frac{AL^2}{BL \\cdot CL}\\]\nNow note that $BL$ and $CL$ are part of the same chord in the circle, so we can use Power of a point to express their product differently. \\[BL \\cdot CL = AL \\cdot LD \\implies AB \\cdot AC = ID^2 \\cdot \\frac{AL}{LD}\\]\nNow we have some sort of expression for $AB \\cdot AC$ in terms of $ID$ and $AL$. Let's try to find $AL$ first.\nDrop an altitude from $D$ to $BC$, $I$ to $AC$, and $I$ to $BC$:\n\nSince $\\angle DBE \\cong \\angle IAF$ and $\\angle BED \\cong \\angle IFA$, $\\triangle BDE \\sim \\triangle AIF$.\nFurthermore, we know $BD = ID$ and $AI = ID$, so $BD = AI$. Since we have two right similar triangles and the corresponding sides are equal, these two triangles are actually congruent: this implies that $DE = IF = 6$ since $IF$ is the inradius.\nNow notice that $\\triangle IGL \\sim \\triangle DEL$ because of equal vertical angles and right angles. Furthermore, $IG$ is the inradius so it's length is $6$, which equals the length of $DE$. Therefore these two triangles are congruent, so $IL = DL$.\nSince $IL+DL = ID$, $ID = 2 \\cdot IL$. Furthermore, $AL = AI + IL = ID + IL = 3 \\cdot IL$. \nWe can now plug back into our initial equations for $AB \\cdot AC$:\nFrom $1.1$, $AB \\cdot AC = 2 \\cdot AL \\cdot ID = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot IL \\cdot 2 \\cdot IL$\n\\[\\implies AB \\cdot AC = 3 \\cdot (2 \\cdot IL) \\cdot (2 \\cdot IL) = 3 \\cdot ID^2\\]\nAlternatively, from $1.2$, $AB \\cdot AC = ID^2 \\cdot \\frac{AL}{DL}$\n\\[\\implies AB \\cdot AC = ID^2  \\cdot \\frac{3 \\cdot IL}{IL} = 3 \\cdot ID^2\\]\nNow all we need to do is find $ID$.\nThe problem now becomes very simple if one knows Euler's Formula for the distance between the incenter and the circumcenter of a triangle. This formula states that $OI^2 = R(R-2r)$, where $R$ is the circumradius and $r$ is the inradius. We will prove this formula first, but if you already know the proof, skip this part.\nTheorem: in any triangle, let $d$ be the distance from the circumcenter to the incenter of the triangle. Then $d^2 = R \\cdot (R-2r)$, where $R$ is the circumradius of the triangle and $r$ is the inradius of the triangle.\nProof:\nConstruct the following diagram:\n\n\n\nLet $OI = d$, $OH = R$, $IF = r$. By the Power of a Point, $IH \\cdot IJ = AI \\cdot ID$.\n$IH = R+d$ and $IJ = R-d$, so \\[(R+d) \\cdot (R-d) = AI \\cdot ID = AI \\cdot CD\\]\nNow consider $\\triangle ACD$. Since all three points lie on the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABC$, the two triangles have the same circumcircle. Thus we can apply law of sines and we get $\\frac{CD}{\\sin(\\angle DAC)} = 2R$. This implies\n\\[(R+d)\\cdot (R-d) = AI \\cdot 2R \\cdot \\sin(\\angle DAC)\\]\nAlso, $\\sin(\\angle DAC)) = \\sin(\\angle IAF))$, and $\\triangle IAF$ is right. Therefore \\[\\sin(\\angle IAF) = \\frac{IF}{AI} = \\frac{r}{AI}\\]\nPlugging in, we have \n\\[(R+d)\\cdot (R-d) = AI \\cdot 2R \\cdot \\frac{r}{AI} = 2R \\cdot r\\]\nThus \\[R^2-d^2 = 2R \\cdot r \\implies d^2 = R \\cdot (R-2r)\\]\n\n\nNow we can finish up our solution. We know that $AB \\cdot AC = 3 \\cdot ID^2$. Since $ID = AI$, $AB \\cdot AC = 3 \\cdot AI^2$. Since $\\triangle AOI$ is right, we can apply the pythagorean theorem: $AI^2 = AO^2-OI^2 = 13^2-OI^2$.\nPlugging in from Euler's formula, $OI^2 = 13 \\cdot (13 - 2 \\cdot 6) = 13$.\nThus $AI^2 = 169-13 = 156$.\nFinally $AB \\cdot AC = 3 \\cdot AI^2 = 3 \\cdot 156 = \\textbf{468}$.\n\n~KingRavi\nBy Euler's formula $OI^{2}=R(R-2r)$, we have $OI^{2}=13(13-12)=13$. Thus, by the Pythagorean theorem, $AI^{2}=13^{2}-13=156$. Let $AI\\cap(ABC)=M$; notice $\\triangle AOM$ is isosceles and $\\overline{OI}\\perp\\overline{AM}$ which is enough to imply that $I$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AM}$, and $M$ itself is the midpoint of $II_{a}$ where $I_{a}$ is the $A$-excenter of $\\triangle ABC$. Therefore, $AI=IM=MI_{a}=\\sqrt{156}$ and \\[AB\\cdot AC=AI\\cdot AI_{a}=3\\cdot AI^{2}=\\boxed{468}.\\]\nNote that this problem is extremely similar to [2019 CIME I/14](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2019_CIME_I_Problems/Problem_14).\nDenote $AB=a, AC=b, BC=c$. By the given condition, $\\frac{abc}{4A}=13; \\frac{2A}{a+b+c}=6$, where $A$ is the area of $\\triangle{ABC}$.\nMoreover, since $OI\\bot AI$, the second intersection of the line $AI$ and $(ABC)$ is the reflection of $A$ about $I$, denote that as $D$. By the incenter-excenter lemma, $DI=BD=CD=\\frac{AD}{2}\\implies BD(a+b)=2BD\\cdot c\\implies a+b=2c$.\nThus, we have $\\frac{2A}{a+b+c}=\\frac{2A}{3c}=6, A=9c$.

We have 200+200+200+1 = 601.\nWe have\n\\begin{align*}\n& a^2 b + a^2 c + b^2 a + b^2 c + c^2 a + c^2 b \\\\\n& = ab \\left( a + b \\right) + bc \\left( b + c \\right) + ca \\left( c + a \\right) \\\\\n& = ab \\left( 300 - c \\right) + bc \\left( 300 - a \\right) + ca \\left( 300 - b \\right) \\\\\n& = 300 \\left( ab + bc + ca \\right) - 3 abc \\\\\n& = -3 \\left(\n\\left( a - 100 \\right) \\left( b - 100 \\right) \\left( c - 100 \\right)\n- 10^4 \\left( a + b + c \\right) + 10^6\n\\right) \\\\\n& = -3 \\left(\n\\left( a - 100 \\right) \\left( b - 100 \\right) \\left( c - 100 \\right)\n- 2 \\cdot  10^6\n\\right) \\\\\n& = 6 \\cdot 10^6 .\n\\end{align*}\nThe first and the fifth equalities follow from the condition that $a+b+c = 300$.\nTherefore,\n\\[\n\\left( a - 100 \\right) \\left( b - 100 \\right) \\left( c - 100 \\right) = 0 .\n\\]\nCase 1: Exactly one out of $a - 100$, $b - 100$, $c - 100$ is equal to 0.\nStep 1: We choose which term is equal to 0. The number ways is 3.\nStep 2: For the other two terms that are not 0, we count the number of feasible solutions.\nW.L.O.G, we assume we choose $a - 100 = 0$ in Step 1. In this step, we determine $b$ and $c$.\nRecall $a + b + c = 300$. Thus, $b + c = 200$.\nBecause $b$ and $c$ are nonnegative integers and $b - 100 \\neq 0$ and $c - 100 \\neq 0$, the number of solutions is 200.\nFollowing from the rule of product, the number of solutions in this case is $3 \\cdot 200 = 600$.\nCase 2: At least two out of $a - 100$, $b - 100$, $c - 100$ are equal to 0.\nBecause $a + b + c = 300$, we must have $a = b = c = 100$.\nTherefore, the number of solutions in this case is 1.\nPutting all cases together, the total number of solutions is $600 + 1 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(601) }}$.\n\n~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com)\nWe will use Vieta's formulas to solve this problem. We assume $a + b + c = 300$, $ab + bc + ca = m$, and $abc = n$. Thus $a$, $b$, $c$ are the three roots of a cubic polynomial $f(x)$.\nWe note that $300m = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)=\\sum_{cyc} a^2b + 3abc = 6000000 + 3n$, which simplifies to $100m - 2000000 = n$.\nOur polynomial $f(x)$ is therefore equal to $x^3 - 300x^2 + mx - (100m - 2000000)$. Note that $f(100) = 0$, and by polynomial division we obtain $f(x) = (x - 100)(x^2 - 200x - (m-20000))$.\nWe now notice that the solutions to the quadratic equation above are $x = 100 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{200^2 - 4(m - 20000)}}{2} = 100 \\pm \\sqrt{90000 - 4m}$, and that by changing the value of $m$ we can let the roots of the equation be any pair of two integers which sum to $200$. Thus any triple in the form $(100, 100 - x, 100 + x)$ where $x$ is an integer between $0$ and $100$ satisfies the conditions.\nNow to count the possible solutions, we note that when $x \\ne 100$, the three roots are distinct; thus there are $3! = 6$ ways to order the three roots. As we can choose $x$ from $0$ to $99$, there are $100 \\cdot 3! = 600$ triples in this case. When $x = 100$, all three roots are equal to $100$, and there is only one triple in this case.\nIn total, there are thus $\\boxed{601}$ distinct triples.\n~GaloisTorrent <3\nLet's define $a=100+x$, $b=100+y$, $c=100+z$. Then we have $x+y+z=0$ and $6000000 = \\sum a^2(b+c)$\n$= \\sum (100+x)^2(200-x) = \\sum (10000+200x+x^2)(200-x) = \\sum (20000 - 10000 x + x(40000-x^2))$\n$= \\sum (20000 + 30000 x -x^3) = 6000000 - \\sum x^3$, so we get $x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 0$. Then from $x+y+z = 0$, we can find $0 = x^3+y^3+z^3 = x^3+y^3-(x+y)^3 = 3xyz$, which means that one of $a$, $b$,$c$ must be 0. There are 201 solutions for each of $a=0$, $b=0$ and $c=0$, and subtract the overcounting of 2 for solution $(200, 200, 200)$, the final result is $201 \\times 3 - 2 = \\boxed{601}$.\nDan Li\n\ndan", "answer": "601", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2024_AIME_II_Problems/Problem_11"}

Since a, b, c, and d is the largest possible number between 0 to 9, we use casework to determine the answer is a=5, b=6, c=9, and d=4, which gives us an answer of $5+694=\\boxed{699}$\n~Callisto531 and his dad", "answer": "699", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2024_AIME_II_Problems/Problem_7"}
{"id": 88, "problem": "Torus $T$ is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius $3$ around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance $6$ from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let $S$ be a sphere with a radius $11$. When $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_i$, and when $T$ rests on the outside of $S$, it is externally tangent to $S$ along a circle with radius $r_o$. The difference $r_i-r_o$ can be written as $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.", "solution": "First, let's consider a section $\\mathcal{P}$ of the solids, along the axis.\nBy some 3D-Geomerty thinking, we can simply know that the axis crosses the sphere center. So, that is saying, the $\\mathcal{P}$ we took crosses one of the equator of the sphere.\nHere I drew two graphs, the first one is the case when $T$ is internally tangent to $S$,\n\nand the second one is when $T$ is externally tangent to $S$.\n\nFor both graphs, point $O$ is the center of sphere $S$, and points $A$ and $B$ are the intersections of the sphere and the axis. Point $E$ (ignoring the subscripts) is one of the circle centers of the intersection of torus $T$ with section $\\mathcal{P}$. Point $G$ (again, ignoring the subscripts) is one of the tangents between the torus $T$ and sphere $S$ on section $\\mathcal{P}$. $EF\\bot CD$, $HG\\bot CD$.\nAnd then, we can start our calculation.\nIn both cases, we know $\\Delta OEF\\sim \\Delta OGH\\Longrightarrow \\frac{EF}{OE} =\\frac{GH}{OG}$.\nHence, in the case of internal tangent, $\\frac{E_iF_i}{OE_i} =\\frac{G_iH_i}{OG_i}\\Longrightarrow \\frac{6}{11-3} =\\frac{r_i}{11}\\Longrightarrow r_i=\\frac{33}{4}$.\nIn the case of external tangent, $\\frac{E_oF_o}{OE_o} =\\frac{G_oH_o}{OG_o}\\Longrightarrow \\frac{6}{11+3} =\\frac{r_o}{11}\\Longrightarrow r_o=\\frac{33}{7}$.\nThereby, $r_i-r_o=\\frac{33}{4}-\\frac{33}{7}=\\frac{99}{28}$.

{"id": 89, "problem": "There is a collection of $25$ indistinguishable white chips and $25$ indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the $25$ unit cells of a $5\\times5$ grid such that: \n\neach cell contains at most one chip\nall chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour\nany additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.", "solution": "The problem says \"some\", so not all cells must be occupied.\nWe start by doing casework on the column on the left. There can be 5,4,3,2, or 1 black chip. The same goes for white chips, so we will multiply by 2 at the end. There is $1$ way to select $5$ cells with black chips. Because of the 2nd condition, there can be no white, and the grid must be all black- $1$ way . There are $5$ ways to select 4 cells with black chips. We now consider the row that does not contain a black chip. The first cell must be blank, and the remaining $4$ cells have $2^4-1$ different ways($-1$ comes from all blank). This gives us $75$ ways. Notice that for 3,2 or 1 black chips on the left there is a pattern. Once the first blank row is chosen, the rest of the blank rows must be ordered similarly. For example, with 2 black chips on the left, there will be 3 blank rows. There are 15 ways for the first row to be chosen, and the following 2 rows must have the same order. Thus, The number of ways for 3,2,and 1 black chips is $10*15$, $10*15$, $5*15$. Adding these up, we have $1+75+150+150+75 = 451$. Multiplying this by 2, we get $\\boxed{902}$.\n~westwoodmonster\nNote that the answer is equivalent to the number of ways to choose rows and columns that the white chips occupy, as once those are chosen, there is only one way to place the chips, and every way to place the chips corresponds to a set of rows and columns occupied by the white pieces.\nIf the white pieces occupy none of the rows, then because they don't appear on the board, they will not occupy any of the columns. Similar logic can be applied to show that if white pieces occupy all of the rows, they will also occupy all of the columns.\nThe number of sets of rows and columns that white can occupy are $2^{5} - 2 = 30$ each, accounting for the empty and full set.\nSo, including the board with 25 white pieces and the board with 25 black pieces, the answer is $30^{2}+2 = \\boxed{902}$\nCase 1: All chips on the grid have the same color.\nIn this case, all cells are occupied with chips with the same color.\nTherefore, the number of configurations in this case is 2.\nCase 2: Both black and white chips are on the grid.\nObservation 1: Each colored chips must occupy at least one column and one row.\nThis is because, for each given color, there must be at least one chip. Therefore, all chips placed in the cells that are in the same row or the same column with this given chip must have the same color with this chip.\nObservation 2: Each colored chips occupy at most 4 rows and 4 columns.\nThis directly follows from Observation 1.\nObservation 3: For each color, if all chips in this color occupy columns with $x$-coordinates $\\left\\{ x_1, \\cdots, x_m \\right\\}$ and rows with $y$-coordinates $\\left\\{ y_1, \\cdots, y_n \\right\\}$, then every cell $\\left( x, y \\right)$ with $x \\in \\left\\{ x_1, \\cdots , x_m \\right\\}$ and $y \\in \\left\\{ y_1, \\cdots , y_n \\right\\}$ is occupied by a chip with the same color.\nThis is because, if there is any cell in this region occupied by a chip with a different color, it violates Condition 2.\nIf there is any cell in this region that is empty, then it violates Condition 3.\nObservation 4: For each color, if all chips in this color occupy columns with $x$-coordinates $\\left\\{ x_1, \\cdots, x_m \\right\\}$ and rows with $y$-coordinates $\\left\\{ y_1, \\cdots, y_n \\right\\}$, then every cell $\\left( x, y \\right)$ with $x \\notin \\left\\{ x_1, \\cdots , x_m \\right\\}$ and $y \\in \\left\\{ y_1, \\cdots , y_n \\right\\}$, or $x \\in \\left\\{ x_1, \\cdots , x_m \\right\\}$ and $y \\notin \\left\\{ y_1, \\cdots , y_n \\right\\}$ is empty.\nThis is because, if there is any cell in this region occupied by a chip with a different color, it violates Condition 2.\nObservation 5: For each color, if all chips in this color occupy columns with $x$-coordinates $\\left\\{ x_1, \\cdots, x_m \\right\\}$ and rows with $y$-coordinates $\\left\\{ y_1, \\cdots, y_n \\right\\}$, then every cell $\\left( x, y \\right)$ with $x \\notin \\left\\{ x_1, \\cdots , x_m \\right\\}$ and $y \\notin \\left\\{ y_1, \\cdots , y_n \\right\\}$ is occupied by chips with the different color.\nThis follows from Condition 3.\nBy using the above observations, the number of feasible configurations in this case is given by\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{n=1}^4 \\sum_{m=1}^4 \\binom{5}{n} \\binom{5}{m}\n& = \\left( \\sum_{n=1}^4 \\binom{5}{n} \\right)\n\\left( \\sum_{m=1}^4 \\binom{5}{m} \\right) \\\\\n& = \\left( 2^5 - 2 \\right)^2 \\\\\n& = 900 .\n\\end{align*}\nPutting all cases together, the total number of feasible configurations is $2 + 900 =  \\boxed{\\textbf{(902) }}$.\n\n~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com)", "answer": "902", "url": "https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2024_AIME_II_Problems/Problem_9"}
