Added tool properties, imports, and ensured BaseClient initialized. All operator calls now include required kwargs client, task_type, question. Introduced a single prompt variable ANALYSIS_PROMPT in prompt_custom. Kept code changes within 5 lines in body where applicable and ensured new properties and prompt are included.
