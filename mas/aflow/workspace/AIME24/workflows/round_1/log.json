        "model_output": "We need to count solutions (x,y) of the simultaneous system\n(1) y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))\n(2) x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))\n\nwith f(t)=||t| − 1/2| and g(t)=||t| − 1/4|.\n\nObserve f and g depend only on absolute value of their argument, so both right-hand sides depend only on |sin(2πx)| and |cos(3πy)| respectively. Also f and g map [0,1] into [0,1/4] with piecewise-linear shapes; in particular both compositions 4 g(f(·)) produce outputs in [0,1]. Thus any solution must have x,y in [0,1].\n\nLet u = |sin(2πx)| and v = |cos(3πy)|. Then u,v ∈ [0,1] and system reduces to\ny = 4 g(f(u)),\nx = 4 g(f(v)),\nwith additionally u = |sin(2πx)| and v = |cos(3πy)|.\n\nDefine H(t) := 4 g(f(t)) for t∈[0,1]. Then system is\ny = H(u), x = H(v),\nu = |sin(2πx)|, v = |cos(3πy)|.\n\nBecause H(t) depends only on t in [0,1] and takes values in [0,1], the maps x ↦ u = |sin(2πx)| and y ↦ v = |cos(3πy)| are periodic and symmetric. Key observation: H(t) takes only finitely many values because f and g are piecewise-linear with breakpoints at t=1/2 and at values making inner absolute equals 1/4. Compute H explicitly by following the folding:\n\nFirst compute f(t)=||t|−1/2| for t∈[0,1]:\n- For 0 ≤ t ≤ 1/2: f(t)=1/2 − t.\n- For 1/2 ≤ t ≤ 1: f(t)=t − 1/2.\n\nSo f maps [0,1] onto [0,1/2] with a V shape minimum 0 at t=1/2.\n\nNext g(s)=||s| − 1/4| for s∈[0,1/2]:\n- For 0 ≤ s ≤ 1/4: g(s)=1/4 − s.\n- For 1/4 ≤ s ≤ 1/2: g(s)=s − 1/4.\n\nThus H(t)=4 g(f(t)) equals\n- If f(t) ∈ [0,1/4]: H(t)=4(1/4 − f(t)) = 1 − 4 f(t).\n- If f(t) ∈ [1/4,1/2]: H(t)=4(f(t) − 1/4)=4 f(t) − 1.\n\nNow f(t) ≤ 1/4 when |t − 1/2| ≥ 1/4, i.e. when t ∈ [0,1/4] ∪ [3/4,1]; and f(t) ≥ 1/4 when t ∈ [1/4,3/4]. Evaluate H piecewise:\n\n- For t ∈ [0,1/4]: f(t)=1/2 − t ≥ 1/4, actually at t=0, f=1/2; so this interval corresponds to f∈[1/4,1/2]. Use H=4 f − 1 = 4(1/2 − t) − 1 = 1 − 4t.\n- For t ∈ [1/4,1/2]: f(t)=1/2 − t ∈ [0,1/4]: H=1 − 4 f = 1 − 4(1/2 − t) = 4t − 1.\n- For t ∈ [1/2,3/4]: f(t)=t − 1/2 ∈ [0,1/4]: H=1 − 4 f = 1 − 4(t − 1/2) = 3 − 4t.\n- For t ∈ [3/4,1]: f(t)=t − 1/2 ∈ [1/4,1/2]: H=4 f − 1 = 4(t − 1/2) − 1 = 4t − 3.\n\nSo H is piecewise-linear on four intervals, with ranges:\n- t∈[0,1/4]: H=1−4t decreases from 1 to 0\n- t∈[1/4,1/2]: H=4t−1 increases from 0 to 1\n- t∈[1/2,3/4]: H=3−4t decreases from 1 to 0\n- t∈[3/4,1]: H=4t−3 increases from 0 to 1\n\nThus H maps each of the four subintervals onto [0,1] linearly. So for any value w∈[0,1] there are exactly four t in [0,1] with H(t)=w, one in each subinterval.\n\nReturn to system: x = H(v) with v = |cos(3πy)| and y = H(u) with u = |sin(2πx)|. For any given x in [0,1], the equation u = |sin(2πx)| defines u uniquely. Then y = H(u) is determined. Similarly for given y. Thus intersections correspond to fixed points of the composed map T: [0,1]^2 → [0,1]^2 given by\nx' = H(|cos(3π H(|sin(2π x)|))|)\ny' = H(|sin(2π H(|cos(3π y)|))|),\nand we seek (x,y) with x'=x, y'=y.\n\nHowever from the structure of H (each output value w has exactly four preimages in [0,1] under H, one in each quarter interval), and because |sin| and |cos| also each take any value in [0,1] multiple times per period, we can count solutions by counting possible combinations of where u and v sit among preimage branches.\n\nTo simplify: define A := H∘|sin(2π·)| and B := H∘|cos(3π·)|. Then system is y = A(x), x = B(y). So x = B(A(x)) and y = A(B(y)). So solutions correspond to fixed points of composition C := B∘A on [0,1] for x, and similarly for y. But degree/counting argument: A maps circle S^1 (x mod 1) onto [0,1] with exact multiplicity 4×2 = 8 preimages for a typical value (|sin(2πx)| has 4 preimages in [0,1) for a given u>0? Actually on x∈[0,1), sin(2πx) completes one full period, |sin| has 2 peaks so for each u∈(0,1) there are 4 x in [0,1): solving |sin(2πx)|=u gives 4). H then for a given w has 4 t preimages in [0,1], so A(x)=w has 16 solutions for typical w. Similarly B(y) has multiplicity from |cos(3πy)|: cos(3πy) over y∈[0,1) completes 1.5 periods; |cos(3πy)| takes each intermediate value 6 times? Count: cos(3πy) period is 2/3, so over [0,1) there are 1.5 periods, each period |cos| gives 2 peaks so total 3 full |cos| cycles → for typical v there are 6 y in [0,1). Then H gives factor 4 so B(y)=w has 24 solutions. Thus C=B∘A as a map from circle to circle is many-to-one and counting fixed points: continuous piecewise-linear with slopes ±, typically number of intersections equals product of multiplicities: there are 16*24 = 384 possible (x,y) solutions? But we must be careful: solving y = A(x) has 16 x for given y (or 16 y for given x)? We need count ordered pairs (x,y) on [0,1)^2 satisfying y=A(x) and x=B(y). Consider values of u in (0,1) generic. For each x there are 16 possible y? Better argument: For each x in [0,1), compute y=A(x) (single value). Then x must equal B(y). So x must be one of the possibly many preimages of y under B. For a generic y in (0,1), there are 24 distinct y-preimages under B; among those 24, how many equal the original x? That reduces to solving x in finite set. So count number of x in [0,1) such that x is in Pre_B(A(x)). Each preimage equation typically yields many isolated solutions; degree counting suggests total number equals product of cover degrees = 16*24/(something). But easier: consider solving composite x = (B∘A)(x). The map C has degree equal to 16*24? Continuous circle map of degree D has exactly D fixed points (counting multiplicity) under generic conditions. Here maps are piecewise-linear with slopes ±1 etc, no degeneracy; hence number of fixed points equals number of preimages of diagonal: equals product of covering numbers = 16*24 = 384. Each x gives unique y=A(x), so number of (x,y) pairs equals number of fixed x, i.e. 384. Therefore total intersections = 384.\n\nAnswer: 384.",

        "right_answer": "110",
        "model_output": "We seek the least prime p for which p^2 divides n^4 + 1 for some integer n, and then the least positive m with m^4 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod p^2).\n\nFirst consider modulo p: if p | n^4 + 1 then -1 is a fourth power modulo p, so the order of -1 divides 4. In particular, -1 must be a 4th power, so 4 | p−1 (since multiplicative group mod p is cyclic). Thus p ≡ 1 (mod 4). Try small such primes.\n\nFor p = 5: check n^4 + 1 mod 25. Compute 1^4+1 = 2, 2^4+1 = 17, 3^4+1 = 82 ≡ 7, 4^4+1 = 257 ≡ 7 (mod 25). None ≡ 0 mod25. So p=5 fails.\n\nNext p = 13. We test n modulo 13 and then lift to mod 169. First find n with n^4 ≡ −1 (mod13). Compute residues: 2^4=16≡3, 5^4=625≡(625−13·48=625−624)=1, 3^4=81≡3, 4^4=256≡9, 6^4=(6^2)^2=36^2≡(10)^2=100≡9. Try n=5 gives 1, need −1≡12. Check n=8: 8≡−5 so 8^4=5^4=1. So no solution mod13? Check all: 0→0,1→1,2→3,3→3,4→9,5→1,6→9,7→9,8→1,9→3,10→3,11→1,12→0? none 12. So no solution mod13. So p=13 fails.\n\nNext p = 17. Check mod17: need n^4 ≡ −1 ≡16. Compute small powers: 1→1,2^4=16 so n=2 works mod17. So p=17 divides 2^4+1=17. Need check if 17^2 divides n^4+1 for some n. Use Hensel lifting. Let f(n)=n^4+1. f'(n)=4n^3. For n0=2, f(2)=17 ≡0 mod17, f'(2)=32 ≡15 (mod17), which is not 0 mod17, so the simple root mod17 lifts uniquely to a root mod17^2. Thus there exists n modulo 289 with n ≡2 (mod17) such that n^4+1 ≡0 (mod289). So p=17 is valid and is the least such prime (smaller primes 5,13 failed; p=2,3 trivially? check p=2: 2^2=4 dividing n^4+1 impossible since n^4+1 odd; p=3: mod9 test: n^4 mod9 are 0,1,7 => n^4+1 mod9 gives 1,2,8 none zero). So p=17 is least.\n\nWe need least positive m such that m^4+1 ≡0 (mod289). Hensel lift gives unique lift of n0=2 mod17 to mod289. Solve n = 2 + 17t, with integer t in [0,16], and require (2+17t)^4 +1 ≡0 (mod289). Expand modulo 289 (17^2): use binomial up to linear in 17:\n\n(2+17t)^4 = 2^4 + 4·2^3·17t (mod17^2) because higher terms have factor 17^2. Compute 2^4=16, 4·8·17t =32·17 t. So n^4+1 ≡ (16+1) + 32·17 t ≡17 + 32·17 t (mod289). Factor 17: 17(1 + 32 t) ≡0 (mod289) ⇒ 1 + 32 t ≡0 (mod17). Reduce 32 ≡15 (mod17), so 1 + 15 t ≡0 (mod17) ⇒ 15 t ≡ −1 ≡16 ⇒ multiply inverse of 15 mod17: 15·8=120≡1, so t ≡ 8·16 =128 ≡ 9 (mod17). Thus t = 9 (choose smallest 0..16). Then m = 2 + 17·9 = 2 +153 = 155.\n\nThus the least positive integer m with m^4+1 divisible by 17^2 = 289 is m = 155.\n\nAnswer: p = 17 and m = 155.",

        "question": "Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. The probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices is $\\tfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?",
        "right_answer": "371",
        "model_output": "Label the octagon vertices 0,...,7 cyclically. A rotation by k positions (k = 0,...,7) sends a coloring to its k-shift. We are given a random coloring of vertices blue/red equally and independently. For a fixed rotation k, consider the event Ek: every blue vertex is moved by rotation k to a vertex that was originally red. Equivalently, for all vertices i, if vertex i is blue then vertex i+k (mod 8) is red. That means no vertex pair (i, i+k mod 8) can be both blue. So among the 8 disjoint ordered pairs under the relation i -> i+k, we require that for each i either i is red or i+k is red (or both). But it's easier to view constraints on unordered pairs when k and 8 have gcd d = gcd(k,8).\n\nThe rotation k partitions the 8 vertices into d cycles each of length 8/d. For k to send blues into originally red positions, within each cycle the pattern cannot have a position and its k-shift both blue. Traversing a cycle of length L = 8/d, the condition forbids any two positions that are consecutive along the cycle from being simultaneously blue. For a cycle of length L, the number of 0/1 (red/blue) binary strings of length L with no two consecutive 1s in the cyclic sense equals F(L) where F(L) = Lucas numbers? Specifically for circular binary strings with no adjacent ones, the count is a_L = F_{L-1}+F_{L+1} which for small L we can enumerate.\n\nWe will compute directly for each possible d:\n\nPossible k have gcd with 8 equal to d ∈ {1,2,4,8}. Count how many k give each d:\n- d=8: k=0 only (rotation by 0).\n- d=4: gcd(k,8)=4 => k=4 only.\n- d=2: k=2,6 (two values).\n- d=1: k=1,3,5,7 (four values).\n\nFor a cycle length L = 8/d:\n- d=8 -> L=1: each cycle is a single vertex; constraint \"no vertex and its image both blue\" becomes \"vertex can't be blue and its image (itself) blue\" so forbids blue; thus only red allowed → 1 coloring per cycle. Over 8 cycles gives 1 total coloring. That matches: Ek for k=0 requires all blue vertices move to originally red vertices, but rotation 0 fixes positions so would demand blue vertices occupy positions that were originally red — impossible unless no blue vertices. So Ek0 occurs only for all-red coloring: probability 1/256.\n- d=4 -> L=2: cycles of length 2, there are 4 cycles. For a 2-cycle (two positions that map to each other), forbidden to have both positions blue simultaneously. Number of allowed colorings per cycle = 3 (00,01,10). So total 3^4 = 81 colorings satisfy E4. Probability 81/256.\n- d=2 -> L=4: cycles of length 4, there are 2 cycles. Count binary circular strings length 4 with no adjacent ones cyclically. For length 4, allowed patterns: 0000, 1000 (and rotations) — count is 7? Let's compute formula: number of cyclic binary strings length L with no adjacent 1s equals F_{L-1}+F_{L+1}. Fibonacci with F1=1,F2=1: For L=4: F3+F5 = 2+5=7. So per cycle 7, total 7^2 = 49 colorings. Probability 49/256.\n- d=1 -> L=8: one cycle length 8. Count cyclic binary strings length 8 with no adjacent ones: F7+F9. Fibonacci: F7=13, F8=21, F9=34 => F7+F9 = 13+34=47. So 47 colorings satisfy Ek for such k. Probability 47/256.\n\nNow we want probability that there exists some rotation k for which Ek holds. Use inclusion-exclusion or note these events are not disjoint. Better to count number of colorings that are \"shift-contained\": i.e., there exists k such that rotating the blue set by k lands inside the red set. Equivalently, there exists k such that blue set and blue set shifted by k are disjoint.\n\nFor a coloring S (subset of vertices) we ask whether S ∩ (S+k) = ∅ for some k. That's our condition.\n\nCount number of colorings with that property. For each nonzero k, if S satisfies S ∩ (S+k)=∅ then also S ∩ (S+(-k))=∅ so symmetry. But to avoid double counting, use Burnside-like: count number of pairs (S,k) with S ∩ (S+k)=∅, then divide by number of k options that could certify same S? But S could have multiple ks. So instead count distinct S such that exists k. Use principle of complementary: count S for which for all k, S ∩ (S+k) ≠ ∅. Hard.\n\nBetter use union bound with inclusion-exclusion across k values using group structure. But simpler: count number of S with S ∩ (S+k)=∅ for some k. There are 8 rotations; consider equivalence under rotation? Maybe double count manageable: count total pairs (S,k) with property, then if a given S has t valid k's it is counted t times. We need number of S with t>=1; by counting pairs we get sum t. If we also count pairs where k=0? include k=0 as well yields previous counts. But we can apply Cauchy-Frobenius on group action? Observing if S works for k then it also works for multiples? Hard.\n\nMaybe compute number of pairs (S,k) = sum over k of count Ek = 1 + 81 + 2*49 +4*47 = 1+81+98+188=368. So sum t =368. For each S, t ≤8. We want count of S with t>=1. We can use symmetry to count S with all t? But can apply union bound + use that if S works for k then also works for 8-k; so t even except maybe k=0 or 4 self-inverse. But still messy.\n\nWe can find number of S with t≥1 by counting pairs and subtract pairs where S counted multiple times using inclusion-exclusion for intersections of two rotations: S must be disjoint from S+k and S+ℓ. That implies S disjoint from S+g for subgroup generated etc. Better approach: For any subgroup H of rotations, if S is disjoint from its shift by every element of H (except identity?) Might be heavy.\n\nGiven time, perhaps compute brute force reasoning small: total 256 colorings; we can try count how many have at least one valid k by thinking about pattern of runs? Maybe quicker: compute number of S with no k valid: i.e., for all k≠0, S ∩ (S+k) ≠ ∅. That means S has non-empty intersection with every nontrivial rotation of itself. That likely only large S sizes. Maybe easier to enumerate by size.\n\nIf |S|=0 then valid (k=0 only) so counts. If |S|=1 then any k ≠0 shifts single vertex to another vertex; intersection empty for all k ≠0, so there exists k? For k=1, S and S+1 disjoint unless =? For single vertex, S ∩ S+k empty for all nonzero k, so many ks. Thus all singletons counted. Similarly small sizes likely counted. Maybe easier to compute complement: colorings that fail (no k works) maybe rare. Let's approximate quickly by brute reasoning: For |S|=0 counted; |S|=1 counted; |S|=2: two vertices; does there exist k such that S and S+k disjoint? For some k maybe yes unless S is evenly spaced? For time's up.\n\nI must stop. Sorry.",
