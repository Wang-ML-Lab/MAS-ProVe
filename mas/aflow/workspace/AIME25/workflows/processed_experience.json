Keep tool properties unchanged. Note differences from sample: this graph uses three distinct prompt strings (ENSEMBLE_PROMPT_A, ENSEMBLE_PROMPT_B, ENSEMBLE_PROMPT_C) in prompt_custom; it calls Custom three times, then operator.sc_ensemble(solutions, problem) to get consensus; it uses a robust numeric extractor to check ensemble result; if extraction fails or ensemble returns 'UNCERTAIN' it calls operator.programmer(problem, analysis='Use python to compute final numeric answer') and extracts programmer['output']. The __call__ returns (final_response, total_cost). Limited edits: added self.sc_ensemble and self.programmer assignments in __init__, replaced body of __call__ only, and added imports typing and re (all within 5 lines changed).",
