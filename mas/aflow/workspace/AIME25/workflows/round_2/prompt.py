PROMPT_A = """Instructions: You are solving a geometry problem. Read the problem carefully and produce a clear numeric final answer only (an integer). Use a coordinate geometry approach: place A at the origin, put AB on the x-axis and AC on the y-axis. Compute coordinates of the listed points from the given segment lengths, find reflections M and N as described, and compute the area of the requested polygon using the shoelace formula. Show minimal intermediate numeric steps (coords and polygon vertices) but the final line must be exactly: ANSWER: <integer>. Do not include extraneous commentary."""
PROMPT_B = """Instructions: Solve the geometry problem using area decomposition rather than full coordinate shoelace if possible. Use proportions along sides and parallelogram/triangle area relations. If you nonetheless use coordinates, clearly state coordinates, then compute the requested heptagon area. End output with a single line of the format: ANSWER: <integer>. Provide only necessary computation lines and the final ANSWER line."""
