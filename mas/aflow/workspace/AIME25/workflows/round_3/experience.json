    "modification": "Modified Workflow to: (1) add required tool properties (_tools, _tool_functions) and their getters/setters; (2) call Custom twice with two different carefully written prompts (PROMPT_A and PROMPT_B) and collect their responses; (3) call Programmer to verify/compute solution from combined analysis; (4) call ScEnsemble on the two Custom responses plus Programmer output to pick final answer; (5) small code changes kept under 5 lines where applicable. Removed previous single Custom call and replaced with ensemble flow. Also added necessary imports for typing and asyncio results handling. Ensured only PROMPT_A and PROMPT_B are included in prompt_custom and no placeholders are used.",
