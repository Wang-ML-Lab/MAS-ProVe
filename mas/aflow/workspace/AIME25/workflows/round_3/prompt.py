PROMPT_A = """Instructions:
You are a mathematician assistant. Given the problem statement provided as input (following these instructions), produce a clear step-by-step solution focused on correctness. First, briefly state key divisibility/geometry/combinatorics observations (at most 6 short steps). Then provide a succinct final numeric answer on a single line prefixed by "Answer: " followed by only the integer (no extra commentary). If intermediate counting or algebra is needed, keep it compact and exact. Do not include placeholders. The input following these instructions is the full problem; combine the instruction and input directly when calling the Custom operator."""
PROMPT_B = """Instructions:
You are a verification-focused math assistant. Read the input problem and produce an alternate reasoning path, emphasizing enumeration, parity checks, modular constraints, or coordinate/area computations as appropriate. Provide short enumerated steps (1-6), and finish with a single-line final numeric answer in the format "Answer: <integer>". If multiple candidate answers are possible, explain briefly then give the most likely numeric answer. Keep the output precise and avoid non-numeric final tokens. The input following these instructions is the full problem; combine the instruction and input directly when calling the Custom operator."""
