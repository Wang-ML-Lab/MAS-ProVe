Let walking distance be 9 km. Let t be the coffee time in minutes (same both cases). Convert times to hours.

Case 1: speed s km/h. Total time = 4 hours = walking time 9/s + t/60.
So 9/s + t/60 = 4.  (1)

Case 2: speed s+2 km/h. Total time = 2 h 24 min = 2.4 hours.
So 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4.  (2)

Subtract (2) from (1):
9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6 = 8/5.

Compute left side:
9[(s+2)-s]/[s(s+2)] = 9*2/[s(s+2)] = 18/[s(s+2)] = 8/5.

So s(s+2) = 18 * 5/8 = 90/8 = 45/4 = 11.25.

Thus s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0. Solve:
s = [-2 + sqrt(4 + 45)]/2 = [-2 + sqrt49]/2 = (-2 +7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 (positive root).

Now find t from (1): 9/s = 9/(2.5) = 3.6 hours. So t/60 = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 hours, so t = 24 minutes.

Now for speed s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. Walking time = 9/3 = 3 hours. Add coffee t = 24 minutes = 0.4 hours, so total = 3.4 hours = 3 hours 24 minutes = 204 minutes.

Answer: 204 minutes.

Let the coffee time be t minutes = t/60 hours. Walking distance is 9 km.

When speed s, walking time = 9/s hours. Total time = 9/s + t/60 = 4 hours.
When speed s+2, walking time = 9/(s+2). Total = 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2.4 hours.

Subtract the second from the first to eliminate t:
9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6

Compute left side:
9[(s+2)-s]/[s(s+2)] = 9(2)/[s(s+2)] = 18/[s(s+2)] = 1.6 = 8/5

So s(s+2) = 18 / (8/5) = 18 * 5/8 = 90/8 = 45/4
Thus s^2 + 2s - 45/4 = 0 → multiply 4: 4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0

Solve quadratic: s = [-8 + sqrt(64 + 720)]/(8) = [-8 + sqrt(784)]/8 = [-8 + 28]/8 = 20/8 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h (positive root)

Now walking speed s+1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. Walking time = 9/3 = 3 hours.

Total time including coffee = walking time + t minutes. Find t: from first equation 9/s + t/60 = 4 → 9/(2.5)=3.6 hours so t/60 = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 hours → t = 0.4*60 = 24 minutes.

Therefore at speed 3 km/h total = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3 hours 24 minutes = 204 minutes.

Let walking distance D = 9 km. Let t be coffee-shop minutes (same both cases). Let s be walking speed in km/h.

Case 1: speed s, total time 4 hours = walking time 9/s hours + coffee time t minutes = t/60 hours.
So 9/s + t/60 = 4.  (1)

Case 2: speed s+2, total time 2 hours 24 minutes = 2.4 hours = 12/5 hours.
So 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 12/5.  (2)

Subtract (2) from (1):
9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 12/5 = 8/5.
Left side = 9[(s+2)-s]/(s(s+2)) = 9*2/(s(s+2)) = 18/(s(s+2)).
So 18/(s(s+2)) = 8/5 => s(s+2) = 18 * 5/8 = 90/8 = 45/4 = 11.25.

So s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0. Solve:
s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)]/2 = (-2 ±7)/2.
Positive root: s = (5)/2 = 2.5 km/h. (Negative root rejected.)

Now find t from (1): 9/s = 9/2.5 = 3.6 hours. Then t/60 = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 hours, so t = 0.4*60 = 24 minutes.

Now for speed s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. Walking time = 9/3 = 3 hours. Total time = walking time + coffee time = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3 hours 24 minutes = 204 minutes.

Answer: 204 minutes.

--- Candidate 1 (891 chars) ---
Let walking distance be 9 km. Let t be the coffee time in minutes (same both cases). Convert times to hours.

Case 1: speed s km/h. Total time = 4 hours = walking time 9/s + t/60.
So 9/s + t/60 = 4.  (1)

Case 2: speed s+2 km/h. Total time = 2 h 24 min = 2.4 hours.
So 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4.  (2)

Subtract (2) from (1):
9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6 = 8/5.

Compute left side:
9[(s+2)-s]/[s(s+2)] = 9*2/[s(s+2)] = 18/[s(s+2)] = 8/5.

So s(s+2) = 18 * 5/8 = 90/8 = 45/4 = 11.25.

Thus s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0. Solve:
s = [-2 + sqrt(4 + 45)]/2 = [-2 + sqrt49]/2 = (-2 +7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 (positive root).

Now find t from (1): 9/s = 9/(2.5) = 3.6 hours. So t/60 = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 hours, so t = 24 minutes.

Now for speed s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. Walking time = 9/3 = 3 hours. Add coffee t = 24 minutes = 0.4 hours, so total = 3.4 hours = 3 hours 24 minutes = 204 minutes.

Answer: 204 minutes.

--- Candidate 2 (985 chars) ---
Let walking distance D = 9 km. Let t be coffee-shop minutes (same both cases). Let s be walking speed in km/h.

Case 1: speed s, total time 4 hours = walking time 9/s hours + coffee time t minutes = t/60 hours.
So 9/s + t/60 = 4.  (1)

Case 2: speed s+2, total time 2 hours 24 minutes = 2.4 hours = 12/5 hours.
So 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 12/5.  (2)

Subtract (2) from (1):
9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 12/5 = 8/5.
Left side = 9[(s+2)-s]/(s(s+2)) = 9*2/(s(s+2)) = 18/(s(s+2)).
So 18/(s(s+2)) = 8/5 => s(s+2) = 18 * 5/8 = 90/8 = 45/4 = 11.25.

So s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0. Solve:
s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)]/2 = (-2 ±7)/2.
Positive root: s = (5)/2 = 2.5 km/h. (Negative root rejected.)

Now find t from (1): 9/s = 9/2.5 = 3.6 hours. Then t/60 = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 hours, so t = 0.4*60 = 24 minutes.

Now for speed s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. Walking time = 9/3 = 3 hours. Total time = walking time + coffee time = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3 hours 24 minutes = 204 minutes.

Answer: 204 minutes.

--- Candidate 3 (987 chars) ---
Let the coffee time be t minutes = t/60 hours. Walking distance is 9 km.

When speed s, walking time = 9/s hours. Total time = 9/s + t/60 = 4 hours.
When speed s+2, walking time = 9/(s+2). Total = 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2.4 hours.

Subtract the second from the first to eliminate t:
9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6

Compute left side:
9[(s+2)-s]/[s(s+2)] = 9(2)/[s(s+2)] = 18/[s(s+2)] = 1.6 = 8/5

So s(s+2) = 18 / (8/5) = 18 * 5/8 = 90/8 = 45/4
Thus s^2 + 2s - 45/4 = 0 → multiply 4: 4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0

Solve quadratic: s = [-8 + sqrt(64 + 720)]/(8) = [-8 + sqrt(784)]/8 = [-8 + 28]/8 = 20/8 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h (positive root)

Now walking speed s+1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. Walking time = 9/3 = 3 hours.

Total time including coffee = walking time + t minutes. Find t: from first equation 9/s + t/60 = 4 → 9/(2.5)=3.6 hours so t/60 = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 hours → t = 0.4*60 = 24 minutes.

Therefore at speed 3 km/h total = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3 hours 24 minutes = 204 minutes.
