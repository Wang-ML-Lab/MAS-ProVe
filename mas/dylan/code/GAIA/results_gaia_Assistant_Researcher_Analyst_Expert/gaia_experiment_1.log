I couldn't find the specific "public logs on the Legume Wikipedia page" with a single search, but the question asks: in 2022 (before December), what does "R" stand for in the three core content policies of Wikipedia that were cited as violated?

Wikipedia's three core content policies are commonly listed as:
- V = Verifiability
- NPOV = Neutral point of view
- NOR (sometimes abbreviated as "No OR" or just "Original research") = No original research

The "R" in that trio refers to "Research" as part of the policy name "No original research." So "R" stands for "Research."
